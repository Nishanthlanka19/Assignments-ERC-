1. Path finding-The assignmnet was to code the  Rapidly Exploring Random Tree algorithm of path planning which is the file named "myrrt". The question or test example for which the code was written is given in the "test_rrt" file.
It was a part of a mini-project that the Electronics and Robotics club conducted during the freshmen year of BITS Pilani Goa campus as an introduction to path planning, with the seniors of the club as mentors.
2. Neural Networks -We were tasked to implement neural networks from scratch without using any frameworks like Pytorch or Tensorflow and train a network to give an XOR function output.
